Heya, I'm Jonathen, I'm currently a student at the University of Alberta!
I'm in my third year of a Bachelor's Degree in Computing Science.
I and a team of 4 other developers created an android mobile application, QuiRky
    You can find the repository here -> https://github.com/CMPUT301W22T29/QuiRky

Have a nice day!
