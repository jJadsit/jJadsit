Heya, I'm Jonathen, I'm currently a student at the University of Alberta!
I'm in my second year of a Bachelor's Degree in Computing Science.
The two projects I'm currently working on is
  A mobile app for Android devices called QuiRky.
    You can find the repository here -> https://github.com/CMPUT301W22T29/QuiRky
  And a personal website, which is not hosted anywhere, but available here
    https://github.com/jJadsit/PersonalWebsite.git

Have a nice day!
