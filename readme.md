Heya, I'm Jonathen, I'm currently a student at the University of Alberta!
I'm in my second year of a Bachelor's Degree in Computing Science.
The only project I'm currently working on is a mobile app for Android devices called QuiRky.
  You can find the repository here -> https://github.com/CMPUT301W22T29/QuiRky
